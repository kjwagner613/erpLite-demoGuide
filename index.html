    <h1>Function without the Complexity</h1>
    <p>Main Menu, when in a module and want to go to another, you have to completely back out to the main menu.</p>

    <h1>Customer Database</h1>
    <p>This is the foundation for everything else. Sales, Product Build, Service Orders. Everything starts as a record assigned to a customer. </p>

    <h1>Shipping and Billing</h1>
    <p>Each customer needs to have ability to have multiple billing profiles and different shipping addresses. This is done by making shipping and billing separate records, with a relationship of one (customer) to many (shipping addresses or billing profiles) but most have only one of each.</p>

    <h1>Applied Philosophy</h1>
    <p>And this single scenario is the cause of so much complexity.  Making allowances for times when a customer has multiple, every other user of the software has to master software with deeply layered menus, crazy transaction codes. Headaches. This is an example of the philosophy I put on the website, applied to this one scenario.</p>

    <a href="https://discdev-erp-lite.netlify.app/">Sales Module Demo</a>
    <p>on the left, the 5 most commonly required departments (modules) for this, for now, only Sales & Distribution is coded, and loaded with demo data.

Access to all departments from any page, on the left of every screen.

Can see customers, related sales orders, and company information all on same page,  
And, I think, the environment is much more soothing. 

What do you think?

I will code the other modules, but as mentioned, everything begins with customers
